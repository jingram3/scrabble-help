scrabble-help
=============

A few functions in Python to help win at Scrabble.

Use 'bingo [tiles]' to check see if you have any 7-letter words.  Use ? for a blank tile.

'bingo stin?at'
conatus
toucans
astound
soutane
outsang
nougats
outmans
amounts
outspan
santour

Otherwise, just type a word to see if it's in the scrabble dictionary.

'hello'
true
