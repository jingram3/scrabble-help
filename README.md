scrabble-help
=============

A few functions in Python to help win at Scrabble.

Use 'bingo [tiles]' to check see if you have any 7-letter words.  Use ? for a blank tile.

'bingo stin?at'
conatus
toucans
astound
soutane
outsang
nougats
outmans
amounts
outspan
santour

Otherwise, just type a word to see if it's in the scrabble dictionary.

'hello'
true

You can also type 'stack [word1] [word2]' to see if 2 words of equal length can be stacked 
so that the vertical columns are also words.

'stack [length]' prints out all of the pairs of words of the specified length that can be stacked.
This returns much more than you would think.
